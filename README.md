# DP---Problems

Solving DP Problems  is going to be EASY , BECAUSE YOU ARE FOLLOWING ME :) 

around 40+ problems includes of easy , medium , hard




Dynamic programming  : 
It is defined as a computer programming technique where an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, the results are saved, and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution â€” which usually has to do with 
finding the maximum and minimum range of the algorithmic query..

 It is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.

For example, if we write simple recursive solution for Fibonacci Numbers, we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by storing solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to linear.

It is OKAY  , if you are not understanding Dp theory wise , think it is of Advance recursion or precomputing and storing it, DRY RUN ALWAYS MY FRIEND :)
